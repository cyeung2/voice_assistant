# voice_assistant
I've created a voice assistant bot that tells the time or pulls weather information using vosk.
Vosk is an offline speech recognition toolkit that helps convert speech into text.
It process was surprisingly simple and anyone who understands the basics can look up and fumble their way through.

# Set Up
To set it up:
<br />
Make sure to install Vosk Model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models, replace the file path.
<br />
For weather functionality, create an Account on tomorrow.io to get API Key, replace the api key.

# To Use Say
Voice Commands: Say the following for each functoinality

Weather:
<br />
what's the weather
<br />
today's weather

Time:
<br />
what's the time
<br />
what time is it
