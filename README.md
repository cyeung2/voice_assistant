# voice_assistant
I've created a voice assistant bot that tells the time or pulls weather information using vosk.
Vosk is an offline speech recognition toolkit that helps convert speech into text.
It process was surprisingly simple and anyone who understands the basics can look up and fumble their way through. 
Overall I think it is a very cool introductory project that can get more kids interested in the computer science field.
